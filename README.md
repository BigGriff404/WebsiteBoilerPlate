## HTML

### Meta Data

The most important thing that I focused on with HTML was the Meta Data for my website.

- Description
- Author
- Keywords
- http-equiv
- Viewport
- mobile-web-app-capable
- theme-color for light and dark color scheme
- Open Graph
- Twitter Cards when sharing the link
- Web App Manifest
- Favicons

& Etc!
