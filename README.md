# WebsiteBoilerPlate

This is my upcoming boilerplate for informational websites!
I'm learning and writing notes/comments. Might even do a video about it!

Shout out to Dennis Ivy (@divanov11 on GitHub) & Traversy Media (@bradtraversy) [(This video opened the door to coding for me!)](https://youtu.be/r_hYR53r61M), Kevin Powell [CSS Master & Web Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) and Brian Design [This is the tutorial I followed.](https://youtu.be/3-2Pj5hxwrw)

I wrote that a long time ago it seems like..

This is now 1/26/2023, I made a life change and I want to win in every aspect!

## console.log

The first thing to notice when you open the website and look at the Developer Tools or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`, is the console and code. Take a look!

I'm not trying to post like I know everything. Just that I'm doing something in general.

The next thing I did was try to understand the console just a little better with Javascript.

## HTML

### Meta Data

The most important thing that I focused on with HTML was the Meta Data for my website.

- Description
![Meta Description Tag](/images/metaDescriptionCode.png "CodeSnap of my Meta Description")
- Author
![Meta Author](/images/metaDescriptionCode.png "CodeSnap of my Meta Author")
- Keywords

- http-equiv
![Meta IE](/images/IECode.png "CodeSnap of my Meta Tag for IE")
- Viewport

- mobile-web-app-capable
![Meta PWA](/images/MobilewebappCode.png "CodeSnap of my Meta Tag for PWA")
- theme-color for light and dark color scheme

- Open Graph

- Twitter Cards when sharing the link

- Web App Manifest

- Favicons (from this [generator](https://realfavicongenerator.net "Favicon Generator")
 I found)

& Etc!

Sooner or later, I will remake this and teach myself all over again while learning Javascript!
