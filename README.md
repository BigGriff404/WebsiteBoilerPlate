# WebsiteBoilerPlate

This is my upcoming boilerplate for informational websites!
I'm learning and writing notes/comments. Might even do a video about it!

Shout out to Dennis Ivy (@divanov11 on GitHub) & Traversy Media (@bradtraversy) [(This video opened the door to coding for me!)](https://youtu.be/r_hYR53r61M), Kevin Powell [CSS Master & Web Accessibility](https://www.youtube.com/@KevinPowell) and Brian Design [This is the tutorial I followed.](https://youtu.be/3-2Pj5hxwrw)

I'm currently trying to create the perfect website to learn from!

Check out the website [here!](https://yungaddyboilerplate.netlify.app "See what I can do!")

## console.log

The first thing to notice when you open the website and look at the Developer Tools or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I`, is the console and code. Take a look!

I'm not trying to post like I know everything. Just that I'm doing something in general.

The next thing I did was try to understand the console just a little better with Javascript.

Sooner or later, I will remake this and teach myself all over again while learning Javascript!
