# Cascading Style Sheet

## Custom Scroll Bar

This feature is 'non-standard' according to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/::-webkit-scrollbar "Scrollbar Information"). I used this to make my website different from others even though it will not work for every user. It definitly works for desktop. I think that was my only goal. I was trying things that I've never tried or heard of before. Being able to use `::-webkit-scrollbar` element helped me understand how customizable a website can be. I made sure that it was seen on Chrome and Firefox.
