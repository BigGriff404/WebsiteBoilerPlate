   <h1>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</h1>
   <p>
    That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. That's a popular name today.
    Little "e", big "B"? No. We're on the top. You don't know how to do any of
    those. You are the last hope of the universe. Morbo can't understand his
    teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a
    man wearing a hat.
   </p>
   <p>
    You lived before you met me?!
    <strong>
     I'll tell them you went down prying the wedding ring off his cold, dead
     finger.</strong
    >
    <em> Can I use the gun?</em> Yeah, I do that with my stupidness.
   </p>
   <h2>Meh.</h2>
   <p>
    Bender, this is Fry's decision… and he made it wrong. So it's time for us to
    interfere in his life. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Wow! A superpowers drug you
    can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to
    freebase.
   </p>
   <ol>
    <li>That's not soon enough!</li>
    <li>And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</li>
    <li>
     Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me.
     Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal?
    </li>
   </ol>

   <h3>
    Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it
    would be something you'd have to freebase.
   </h3>
   <p>
    Bender, being God isn't easy. If you do too much, people get dependent on
    you, and if you do nothing, they lose hope. You have to use a light touch.
    Like a safecracker, or a pickpocket. Now that the, uh, garbage ball is in
    space, Doctor, perhaps you can help me with my sexual inhibitions?
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of
     sleaze that those things bring.
    </li>
    <li>
     Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well,
     how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.
    </li>
    <li>Too much work. Let's burn it and say we dumped it in the sewer.</li>
   </ul>

   <p>
    File not found. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! I love this planet!
    I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things
    bring. Who said that? SURE you can die! You want to die?!
   </p>
   <p>
    Large bet on myself in round one. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any way?
    That's not soon enough! That's right, baby. I ain't your loverboy Flexo, the
    guy you love so much. You even love anyone pretending to be him!
   </p>
   <p>
    Can we have Bender Burgers again? Leela's gonna kill me. I didn't ask for a
    completely reasonable excuse! I asked you to get busy! Who am I making this
    out to?
   </p>
   <p>
    I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food?
    I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Daylight
    and everything. Throw her in the brig. Uh, is the puppy mechanical in any
    way?
   </p>
   <p>
    We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and
    neutral! I don't 'need' to drink. I can quit anytime I want! No, I'm Santa
    Claus! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love!
   </p>
   <p>
    You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Hey, tell me something. You've got
    all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?
    Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker.
   </p>
   <p>
    Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress
    like you're doing your laundry? You seem malnourished. Are you suffering
    from intestinal parasites? Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.
   </p>
   <p>
    Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the
    devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean
    get your coat. Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a
    deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by
    "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.
   </p>
   <p>
    Ah, the 'Breakfast Club' soundtrack! I can't wait til I'm old enough to feel
    ways about stuff! Tell her she looks thin. I had more, but you go ahead.
    Incidentally, you have a dime up your nose.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the lights go out, it's nobody's business what goes on between two
    consenting adults. Or a guy who burns down a bar for the insurance money!
    Are you crazy? I can't swallow that. Goodbye, cruel world. Goodbye, cruel
    lamp. Goodbye, cruel velvet drapes, lined with what would appear to be some
    sort of cruel muslin and the cute little pom-pom curtain pull cords. Cruel
    though they may be…
   </p>
   <p>
    Just once I'd like to eat dinner with a celebrity who isn't bound and
    gagged. I just told you! You've killed me! Ven ve voke up, ve had zese
    wodies. Professor, make a woman out of me. Are you crazy? I can't swallow
    that.
